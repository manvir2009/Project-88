           There are many numbers of physical games but I like to play Volleyball.I like to play Volleyball because it is a great game that is loaded with lots of energy and fun.While some sports may have to be played using plenty number of equipments to play, volleyball, just needs to have a good ball and a net and could be played anywhere, where there is space, unlike other sports like basketball and golf which needs a specific area to play the game.\
            
       

Whether it’s the rush, adrenalin, speed, spikes, pure athleticism and challenging nature of the game, there is no disputing the power of volleyball and people’s love and pure enjoyment of the sport. Since it’s Olympic Games debut – Indoor Volleyball earned its Olympic status at the 1964 Tokyo Olympic Games while Beach Volleyball was officially included on the Olympic programme in 1996 – volleyball has continued to grow and is today considered one of the most popular sports in the world. And the benefits of the game are truly endless.

Volleyball is a great team sport that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and skill levels. One of the many benefits of volleyball is the fact that it can be played year-round in both an indoor and outdoor setting. Aside from the pure enjoyment of the game, there are several reasons why people play volleyball. It’s a great bonding activity for friends and family. It acts as an alternative and highly effective way of reaching your fitness goals in a fun engaging way. Others simply love the game and play volleyball for pure enjoyment. Whatever your reason may be, the physical, mental and emotional benefits of playing volleyball are unparalleled.
